        Frontend Developer with nearly 4 years of professional experience building scalable and responsive web applications. I have worked on a wide range of projects at Zetaequis and BLKMarketâ€”including large-scale e-commerce platforms, admin dashboards, product and user management tools, social features, and NFT marketplaces.
        <br />
        I specialize in modern technologies such as TypeScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Zod, Zustand, TanStack Query, MongoDB, Framer Motion, and Material UI. I am passionate about building fast, responsive, and accessible user interfaces, and I thrive in collaborative team environments with GitHub workflows and deployments via Vercel.
